# 3. Sketching/Material Study/Experimentation & Execution

**A coat of arms for common peace**

Before, the colors used on the symbols were derived from resources that communitite sgathered. The more rare the resource, the accomplishment the color signified. Today it is the opposite, we would have too much to choose from that we could not stop getting lost. What could be defined as achievement today, in a moral and healthy perspective?

IMAGERY

When we are stressed we often look at images of our vacations, nature, cute animals. These are ways of visual relaxation. What images could be used to suggest relaxation and meditation in a public sense? There are a few mathematical and emotional ideas that are in us humans naturally, when they appear in an image, in different colors and forms, it gives the human pleasure and mainly distracts the human from their specific problems in order to meditate to what we are and have achieved. 

SYMBOLISM

I will be using peace symbolism derived from the movements archive material from all around the world. Emphasising the fact that we can only find peace within. I want to use flat, vector symbols since they hold most value in their simplicity. The peace symbols will be taking place inside the surrounding of modern society, also converted figuratively.

MATERIAL

I choose hard surface, man made materials because of how they reflect the achievements and standards of todays society. Even though plexiglass and other plastics are usually not eco-friendly, the man can not let go of the flatness and perfection in cutting that he has achieved. I want to simulate lazer cut materials because this method of achieving near perfection is more and more avaliable, and for me, very exciting. More companies are using recycled plastic and a company named Greencast[[http://www.greencastus.com](http://www.greencastus.com/)] in the USA, sells 100% recycled plexiglass which does not use any transparency and reflection value in the process. Even though it sells at a high price, it is promising that more companies will take into account the environment instead of a lower price. This way the human can still keep his perfected craft while the environment would suffer less than currently. A sustainable cycle is key, but requires dedication and effort, from which the average human get quite easily turned away from.

Separating modern society from peace/soul using material. Modern society can be seen as geometric pieces fitting together (strict, dirty (dust,hair,fingerprints), grey involved). For the peace middle I would see colourful, solid shapes interacting with each other. I want to highlight the separation, isolation and plainness of the outside world. 

Vector process.

After gathering and analysing my collection of peace posters, pins and flyers, I extracted the most powerful forms though vectorisation. After researching and gathering symbols to represent our modern society, I found great excitement when I started combining them. I combine 2 symbols to bring fourth or solidify a statement. I am asseme=bling a toolkit, somewhat a rerstriction but I need these restrictions to play aroudn mroe with the same content, isntead of always switching, in the end usually resulting with a with an exciting composition.

Processed (but more combinations to make) symbols for both fields (modern on the left, peace on the right). The modern symbols represent distractions, materialism, surveillance, corporation and rotting planet. I want to keep the amount of symbols quite low to avoid being too obvious, and have depth in the work which the viewer can explore.

Vector of a plane. This plane, designed by me, represents endless connectivity in a four dimensional space, which in my eyes is our planet. These planes can vary thickness, size, texture etc. but they will still be able to be joined either side by side, or on top of each other (the holes are there either for bolt fastening, hanging, stacking.

Digital sketches of three planes, consisting symbols from both groups. Experimenting with pairing.

Material Study/Experimentation

My intention for design is fusing the physical analog and virtual processes together to take advantage of the precision tools available today, to blur the line between analog and digital. In this part of my process I want to think with the use of physical material. I used a vinyl cutter to create decals from the symbols I gathered and edited. With scanning, applying, sticking, editing, I am exploring the medium. Decals in modern day are used by almost any corporation, brand and business. However decals can also be seen as a highly creative and artistic product coming from designers and artists. This duality of a decal, a symbol, that leads our mind or attention to a specific point is something that can be used or abused. **I see this modern world as an endless room of planes, on which anyone places decals, representing their goal, activity or interest in life, wether it be to create a consumer base or to simply hare your artwork.** What are the visual characteristics of a decal, what makes it look real or simply a vector. Can I control physicality in a virtual way on my computer, producing a result that is neither physical nor digital(in between?).

Some editing to extract the background. I can see that after scanning the images the color has become completely flat. This is nice for posters, but I want to exaggerate the fact that they are sticker decals. The minor drop shadow that is naturally occurring after scanning, because of the micro thickness of the vinyl. I really like the hair and dust details that are captured in this process.  Even though huge  scratches and imperfections can be distracting, micro details, in my opinion play with the viewers interpretation of medium and subtly suggests the digital and analog process.

![3%20Sketching%20Material%20Study%20Experimentation%20Executi%20503e6313de7c4cccb076ad4043c2c275/Screenshot_20200524-154325.png](3%20Sketching%20Material%20Study%20Experimentation%20Executi%20503e6313de7c4cccb076ad4043c2c275/Screenshot_20200524-154325.png)

I realised that this material relies on light for the highly specular reflections. The specularity of plexiglass and decals can be seen as the dynamic, exciting energy that humans posses and reflect. I find it suiting to have this contrast of man made, plastic, vectorised form with natural light, something that is even more precious than the nature.

Because of my recent fasciation in the uniqueness of everything, every dust particle and scratch, I have been experimenting with surface imperfections principles in the digital 3D space. By using PBR shaders (used for advertising/packaging food, cars, toys) I can experiment in a photorealistic environment where light reacts with the objects in a natural way (using HDRI smart illumination photos). Could this technique bring more interesting results to my flat explorations?

I started with experimenting in the 3D space. Playing around how the sticker reacts with light, exploring micro dust from my scans. After these tests I figure that a see-through, plastic, glossy material would be suiting to represent the hectic, confusing and often deceiving society.  

I also experimented with displacement and displacement maps. This allows me to create embossments in the virtual plexi-glass. I want to exaggerate the notion of a cycle so an array of symbols is quite suiting. It even creates a fence feeling which is an object used very often in the man made world(separation, isolation).

Color 

With the planes I want to demonstrate the dynamic, explosive, contradicting nature of the man made world. To suit this I have chosen to use RGB complimentary colors. These are any two colors that are on opposite sides of the color wheel. The combination provides a high contrast and high impact, if together these colors appear brighter and more prominent. I want to highlight that there are principled natures behind man made products, personalities and ideas that bring out emotional excitement. The power of redirecting attention that the human has become so professional at.  

After carrying out some trials, I found that the achromatic grey made up of 50% of red green and blue, makes the colors pop the most. I like what it symbolises as the base plate color, the foundations of the man made world as an even mix of all primary colors.

Sketches to experiment and discover the RGB complimentary colors, as well as trying out compositions and symbol combinations. The white spaces are cut outs on the base plate itself, not decals.

Vector sketches of the peace aspect. Using the symbols I collected and vectorised, I want to compose the peace chapel. I want to bring back symbols that people recognise and may even have seen before, to form a united appreciation space for the human ability to have peace .

Sketch of the coat of arms of common peace. I have realised the use of symbols has to be quite precise in order to achieve a clean and serious look.
