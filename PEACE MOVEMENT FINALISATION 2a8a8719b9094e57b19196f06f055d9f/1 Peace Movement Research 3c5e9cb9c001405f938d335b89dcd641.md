# 1. Peace Movement Research

**Movement Research**

As I scroll the archive, I find a lot of appealing flat visual material from various movements across the world. I am looking for a topic that interests me and observing how it is communicating. I am interested in something I have still not looked into, the overwhelming number of "squatter" items in the archive is not attractive for me. 

**Peace** 

After scrolling through visual documents, to get how the different movements were communicating, I found the Peace movement the most interesting. I saw a lot of black and white, very busy, very colourful prints, however the peace designs had a certain calmness and minimalism to it. Also it is fascinating how the visual documents come from all around the world, but do resemble each other even visually in my eyes.

WW2: a lot of countries had peace groups and initiations, however after being attacked by another country they switched suddenly. 

**Peace Movement (1950s/60s)**

The Peace Movement of the post-World War Two period was the first of the modern social movements in Europe and America. The peace movment did not grow up over night, in the most famous example of Vietnam, the movement had a very small and unmentioned following for the first 5 years or more; it took time to become a mass movement of millions capable of temporarily halting the U.S. war machine. The impact and significance of the peace movement can be seen into the 21st century, when peace movements start, small and as yet marginalised, *before the war itself*! Before the peace movements of the 1950s-60s, anything but patriotism in times of war was called treason and people would be imprisoned, exiled, or murdered (even in so-called "democracies"), today, a peace movement is *expected* to spring up with the onset of any new battle ground in the never ending war of capitalist exploitation.

Thus, although the Peace Movement of the 1950s and early 1960s in most respects resembled the Anti-War Movements of earlier times, it was unique in being a response to a danger rather than actual human suffering. It is further distinguished in the conscious and systematic development of tactics of non-violent action and in the role it played in the initiation of a whole series of social movements which unfolded in to two decades following.

**Modern peace groups (do further research):**

US Peace Council, Veterans for Peace, the International Action Center, Peace Action, Code Pink, the Palestinian US Peace Forum, Black Agenda Report, the Global Network Against Nuclear Power and Weapons in Space, World Beyond War, Jonah House, the Palestinian US Peace Forum, Jewish Voices for Peace, Raging Grannies, the Manhattan Project for a Nuclear Free World, the Green Party.

**"Trump Era" (instability)**

[https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/how-to-revive-the-peace-movement-in-the-trump-era/](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/how-to-revive-the-peace-movement-in-the-trump-era/)

This year, we put at the helm of this global killing regime a reality-TV star who has promised to “bomb the shit” out of our enemies, attack the families of terrorists, and reinstitute torture—and who, in February, proposed increasing the already bloated military budget by $54 billion. Imagine the response of this president to a significant terrorist attack, the damage to our democracy and our world that he might unleash. It helps clear the mind.

In the wake of the election, as the need for a constituency to challenge American militarism grows in urgency, how might such challenges be met? Doing so will require reimagining the constituency, strategy, and purpose of the movement itself. It is not at all clear that a “peace movement” or even an “antiwar movement,” as those have generally been conceived, will suffice. **Rather, we need a movement that can speak to the anger that so many Americans feel toward the corporate powers that dominate our politics.** Such a movement would expose how militarism is not immune to that influence but is particularly beholden to it. Can such a movement be organized?

Yet despite those achievements, the military that Obama passed on to his successor is largely identical to the one he inherited. Troops remain in Afghanistan, making this the longest-running war in American history. In the final years of his presidency, US Special Operations forces were deployed in over 105 countries—more than 80 percent of all of the nations on earth. Obama authorized over 1,800 drone strikes (that we know of), which killed at least 5,500 people. American arms are shipped throughout the world, supplying the machinery for Saudi Arabia’s bombing of Yemen, the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, and Egypt’s domestic repression and counterterrorism operations in the Sinai, to name just three examples. All of this eats up an annual military expenditure larger than that of the next seven nations combined.

What have these billions brought us? Today, Americans are more likely to be killed by their own police, and much more likely to be shot by a neighbor, than by a jihadist. To some, this is proof of the effectiveness of our deterrence; to others, it is evidence of astonishing overreaction. Either way, if the aim of the War on Terror has been to defeat terrorism, then the result has been an unmitigated disaster. In 2002, 725 people were killed in terrorist attacks worldwide; in 2014, that number was over 32,000. According to the Costs of War project at Brown University, the War on Terror has cost the country nearly $5 trillion—enough to guarantee every American citizen a basic income. Or, if you prefer, enough to make public college free for every American student for more than 50 years.

SHOULD WE ACTUALLY FEAR EACH OTHER

HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY - SCARED OF INSECTS, YET WE ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS ANIMAL. 

FEELING OF POWER

There is substance to all this, but in crucial ways the antiwar movement is more a victim of its success than its failures. It has largely won the public and the politics. The massive demonstrations against the wars in Vietnam and Iraq—and the disastrous consequences of those wars—generated real costs for politicians who supported them (just ask Hillary Clinton). Leadership of both parties today remains wary of support for direct intervention. Today, Americans are both opposed to war and accustomed to its permanence.

This paradox holds because our military policy has shielded itself from the public. Members of Congress pay a political price for authorizing war, so they don’t seek authorization. Americans are reluctant to support bombing in countries they’ve never heard of, so the government keeps those bombings secret. We don’t want to pay for missions that lack a clear rationale, so the money is borrowed from future generations. We refuse to allow our soldiers to be killed, so the government attacks its enemies with flying robots and outsources much of the fieldwork to private contractors. We don’t want to face the cost of our foreign entanglements, so a smaller percentage of our country is asked to serve, and serve longer. The irony is that these transformations follow from how politically unpopular war has become. Our wars feel so distant because they’ve been made more distant by design.

**1989 Revolutions**

[https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/can-europe-make-it/1989-revolutions-and-peace-movement/](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/can-europe-make-it/1989-revolutions-and-peace-movement/)

There are two main ways in which the West European peace movements contributed to the 1989 revolutions. First of all, it was peace movement pressure that led to the Intermediate -range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) Treaty in 1987. The West European peace movements had sprung up in response to the American decision to deploy cruise and Pershing missiles in five countries across Western Europe. The theory was that Europeans would feel ‘reassured’ by their presence, which was supposed to demonstrate the American willingness to come to the defence of Western Europe in the event of a Soviet attack. Because the weapons were based in Europe and not the US and because they were more ‘useable’, the theory went, their use might not invite retaliation against US territory and therefore, I kid you not, the Americans would be more willing to use them thereby strengthening the credibility of nuclear deterrence.

The reaction in Western Europe was, of course, the opposite – a genuine fear that these missiles would make nuclear war more likely. Millions demonstrated across Western Europe. Peace camps were set up at the proposed missile sites, of which the most famous was Greenham Common. END called for a European nuclear free zone from Poland to Portugal and the elimination of all intermediate range nuclear weapons – cruise and Pershing missiles and also the Soviet SS-20 missiles.

In response, the Reagan Administration proposed the so-called zero option – the elimination of all intermediate range nuclear weapons. ‘We got the idea from your banners’ I was told by Reagan’s nuclear advisor Richard Burt. The Americans assumed that the Soviet Union would never accept their proposal because they possessed, in numerical terms, many more SS 20s than the proposed cruise and Pershing missiles. However, Gorbachev explicitly accepted the peace movement argument that it is not necessary to have the capability to destroy the world several times over in order to deter a war.

THE WHITE DOVE as a spiritual entity. 

**Why do Doves Represent Love and Peace?**

[https://spiritualray.com/why-is-dove-symbol-of-peace-love](https://spiritualray.com/why-is-dove-symbol-of-peace-love)

Doves are considered birds who mate for life, and are extremely loyal. They raise their young ones with great care and dedication. They build their nests in areas near human settlements. In a way, this may have given people the opportunity to witness the immense love, care, and loyalty displayed by white doves. They are harmless birds and feed on fruits, plants, and seeds. People quickly associated doves with peace, love, and dedication.

- In ancient Aztec culture, the Goddess of Love, Xochiquetzal, is considered the mother of humanity, after the Great Flood. It is believed that she descended on Earth in the form of a dove, and gave the world the gift of speech and languages.
- In Hindu mythology, Kamadeva-the God of love-is known to ride a dove bird. This may also be the reason why doves are associated with love.

- In many religions, there are stories that associate white doves with peace. Christianity and the Bible describe dove as the symbol of peace and love. It is the symbol of the ‘Holy Spirit’, during the Baptism of Jesus Christ.

Doves are referred to the symbol that define the presence of God. The Biblical story of Noah’s Ark truly defines the symbolism of white doves with peace. As per the story, after the Great Flood, Noah sent out white dove to see if there was any land. The dove returned with olive twig its beak, which meant that it had found dry land somewhere. This brought relief to Noah, who had spent almost a year on the ark. Since then, white dove with an olive twig in its beak, is considered symbol of peace.

**TWITTER AS THE WRITING PAD - HOWEVER NOTHING IS ERASED AND EVERYTHING IS EXPOSED AND ARCHIVED**

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256933820_You_are_what_you_tweet_Personality_expression_and_perception_on_Twitter](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256933820_You_are_what_you_tweet_Personality_expression_and_perception_on_Twitter)

One possible explanation of the observed personality percep-tion results is that microblogging affects the expression of extra-version, openness, and conscientiousness. For example, Twitterencourages people to disclose their inner feelings and share theirsocial activities with others, meaning that all users will appearextraverted to some extent. Similarly, most people tend to tweetabout their new experiences or discoveries, giving others theimpression that they are open to new experiences. In fact, the rat-ings of openness (M= 33.44, SD = 1.76) and extraversion(M= 28.67, SD = 2.54) were the ﬁrst and third highest among theratings of the ﬁve traits, and exhibited the least variability. Judg-ments of conscientiousness may suffer from a lack of valid cues,since people may shy away from discussing work due to concernsover being perceived as boring. Neuroticism and agreeableness onthe other hand, may be less affected by the microblogging platform. Neurotic individuals may freely disclose their negativeekmotions and anxiety, while less agreeable individuals may feelless need to inhibit their tendency to disagree with others. There-fore, these two traits may be easier to detect.

**Distracted by hate?**

[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/14/the-lost-art-of-concentration-being-distracted-in-a-digital-world](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/14/the-lost-art-of-concentration-being-distracted-in-a-digital-world)

It is difficult to imagine life before our personal and professional worlds were so dominated and “switched on” via smartphones and the other devices that make us accessible and, crucially, so easily distractible and interruptible every second of the day. This constant fragmentation of our time and concentration has become the new normal, to which we have adapted with ease, but there is a downside: more and more experts are telling us that these interruptions and distractions have eroded our ability to concentrate.

The impact of interruptions on individual productivity can also be catastrophic. In 2002, it was reported that, on average, we experience an interruption every eight minutes or about seven or eight per hour. In an eight-hour day, that is about 60 interruptions. The average interruption takes about five minutes, so that is about five hours out of eight. And if it takes around 15 minutes to resume the interrupted activity at a good level of concentration, this means that we are never concentrating very well.

**Meditation and focus**

Switching off from both external and internal distractions does not come easily. Learning how to be more mindful, practising mindfulness or meditation, can all help facilitate greater concentration, not least because feeling calmer restores equilibrium and focus.

Most of us breathe poorly: we tend to over-breathe, taking three or four breaths using only the upper part of our lung capacity, when one good breath using the lungs more completely would serve us better. This shallow breathing is very tiring, not only because we expend unnecessary muscular energy, but because we reduce our oxygen intake per breath.

PURE PERCEPTION MOVEMENT

CLEANSING MOVEMENT

SAY NO TO SUBJECTIVE POWER

**The Purity Of Perception**

[https://insighttimer.com/blog/cleansing-the-doors-of-perception/](https://insighttimer.com/blog/cleansing-the-doors-of-perception/)

***What happens when the cleansing takes place and we can once again see self and world as they naturally are? What happens when the ego structure fades from view and what neuroscientists call “the neural default mode” is deactivated? What happens when our “person” our personal sense of self with all of its past history and ideas fades from view, losing its shaping influence?***

When this occurs, the clear eyes of perception and awareness once again reveal themselves, as if cleansed of the obscurations and shaping influences of ego and its history. What we see is precisely the same world we saw before, but with a purity of perception and awareness uninfluenced by history and ideations. And that change in perception, that ability to see self and the world precisely *as it is,* rather than as a fabricated personalized world shaped by our inner stories*,* is the difference between heaven and hell, suffering and freedom, pleasure and spontaneous unchanging joy.

One is unshakeable in the conviction that one has touched the truth of life and the essence of living, and that is how it is.

**The Paradox of Perception and Reality**

[https://www.wiseinsights.net/perception-reality-modern-influence/](https://www.wiseinsights.net/perception-reality-modern-influence/)

Here’s what is so strange: when researchers surveyed people’s perception of their immediate personal situation, they were *generally hopeful and even upbeat*.

In this case, their perceptions did align with reality about the general improvement in living conditions.

![https://www.wiseinsights.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/image-result-for-eeyore-images.jpeg](https://www.wiseinsights.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/image-result-for-eeyore-images.jpeg)

But, when you ask them about the state of the world or their nation, that all changes.As Pinker describes it, they

**switch from a hopeful Pollyanna to a gloomy Eeyore.**

What is causing people to perceive positive facts in a negative light?

**One contributing factor** is that humans are hard wired with a [negativity bias](https://www.wiseinsights.net/3-proven-ways-boost-daily-joy-research-backed/).You can [go here to read](https://www.wiseinsights.net/3-proven-ways-boost-daily-joy-research-backed/) all about how it distorts your perceptions of reality (and how you can counteract it).

Although the negativity bias impacts this paradox, it is not at the root of what’s going on here.

**The root cause of this paradox** is related to the phenomenon called [the focusing illusion](https://www.wiseinsights.net/focusing-illusion-distorts-daily-life/). The focusing illusion heightens the prominence and importance of that which you are focusing on.

**The Nature of “News” and the State of the World**

Many of us are exposed to news stories that the news outlets believe will get our attention (and as a result, we focus on). Their mantra is often “If it bleeds, it leads” the reporting.

As Pinker reports, this is the nature of “newsworthy” news.

*“News is about what happens, not what doesn’t happen. So, it features sudden and upsetting events likes fires, plant closings, rampage shootings and shark attacks… You never see a headline about a country that is NOT at war, or a city that has NOT been attacked by terrorists – or the fact that since yesterday, 180,000 people have escaped extreme poverty.”*

In fairness to the news organizations, they serve us a steady diet of this “newsworthy” news because it is the stuff we tend to be most interested in (and pass on to friends and family).

**Our Distorted Perceptions of the Risk & Frequency of Bad Events**

The nature of news (featuring the tragic and dramatic) has skewed our perception about risks.

For example, “people rank tornados (which kills dozens of Americans every year) as more dangerous than asthma (which kills thousands), presumably because tornadoes make for better television.”

**Our perceptions about risk** are *impacted less by statistics and the truth, and more by images and stories.*

The “newsworthy” problem has also been made **much worse by our interconnected world**.

For example, if you lived in a small town 100 years ago, the extent of the news you were exposed to was what happened (good and bad) in that town and the immediate surrounding areas.

In contrast, these days we hear about **EVERY** bad thing going on EVERYWHERE in the country and even the world.

**Pure Perception: Fake It Until You Make It!**

[https://samyeinstitute.org/philosophy/developing-pure-perception-begin/](https://samyeinstitute.org/philosophy/developing-pure-perception-begin/)

In February 2016, Phakchok Rinpoche answered a student question about pure perception. If we have not yet developed true pure perception, is it okay to “fake it”? Or is it better to just let go?

**Pure Perception Takes Time**

Rinpoche explains we need to work slowly. We need to fake it to make it, but we also need to let go. ‘Letting go’ is the emptiness part and ‘faking it to make’ it is the pure perception part. You try to make it up (conceptually thinking “it is pure, all is pure, all is pure), then let go. Very slowly, pure perception will begin to arise because your nature is Buddha. Everybody’s nature is Buddha. But you don’t see the nature yourself and you don’t see other people’s nature. That is the problem.

In the ultimate sense, seeing things as pure is not faking! Yes, in the beginning, we are faking it, because we just don’t see it now. But we need to understand that it is the real truth. We must start by faking it because we don’t see it.

**Compassion Takes Time**

That’s also how we develop compassion–in the beginning we aren’t capable of extending it to all beings. But,we really need to understand that every sentient being is our mother. We need to know that. Don’t let go of compassion. Fake it in the beginning. After time spent practicing regularly, there is no need to fake it, it is real.

And ultimately, is real. We are all related in many lifetimes. Live with that thought for a few minutes. Here we are not knowing each other. Not loving each other. All the different characters—that all disappears. The link of love is automatic. We are interconnected. Don’t worry about believing it or not believing it. Don’t make a big issue about it, but just think, “We are connected.” Then compassion automatically arises. The result will come. When you have compassion, the path is correct.

It is good for us to spend some time talking about these things and to share our understanding.

**THE LOTUS FLOWER MEANING**

[https://www.onetribeapparel.com/blogs/pai/meaning-of-lotus-flower](https://www.onetribeapparel.com/blogs/pai/meaning-of-lotus-flower)

The lotus flower is an old and significant symbol in many religions, especially Hinduism and Buddhism. While there are slight variations to the lotus flower meaning in the different faiths, the general concept is the same. The meaning of the lotus flower comes from the way the flower grows in nature. It starts off as a bud underwater, often in murky ponds, and grows until it emerges from the muddy waters in a beautiful blooming flower.

**Symbol for Spiritual Enlightenment:** The meaning of the lotus flower symbol comes from an analogy derived from the flower's life cycle, where all humans are born into a world of suffering where they must learn to overcome difficult times so that they can become a better person and reach spiritual enlightenment. The muddy waters represent the struggles of life, the bud of the flower represent a person that has not yet reached their full potential, and the blossoming lotus flower above the water represents someone who has achieved nirvana and let go of worldly suffering.

**Symbol for Purity**: The lotus flower emerges from murky waters perfectly clean and beautiful, so it is also a symbol for purity. The meaning of the lotus flower holds such power because it can offer hope and strength to people struggling in their daily lives. It is a symbol that shows that no matter where you start off in life and no matter what you're going through, you have the ability to rise above, overcome all negativity and find bliss as you emerge from your struggles.

Throughout the process of the bud pushing through the murky waters, the petals of the flower are never touched or affected by the water, so the centre remains uncontaminated throughout its unpleasant journey. This is symbolic of the purity of the human soul and how nothing we experience could ever taint it.

**Symbol of Personal Progress**: The physical aspects of the lotus flower have also contributed to its meaning. The lotus flower has many petals that surround the centre in multiple concentric layers. As the petals open, more petals are revealed until the lotus is in full bloom and all the layers are revealed. This process is seen as a metaphor for the progress made in gradual stages to ultimately reach spiritual enlightenment and self-realization.

### THE LOTUS FLOWER IN BUDDHISM

The meaning of the lotus flower in Buddhism comes from that central analogy of being born into a world of struggle (murky water) and opening up to or reaching spiritual enlightenment (the blossoming lotus). In Buddhism, the lotus flower symbolizes purity of the mind, body and spirit, as the flower, or soul, blossoms above and moves freely over murky waters, which represents the struggles of life, attachment and desire.

The flower also symbolizes detachment as water rolls off the petals easily, meaning that the purity of the soul, having reached enlightenment, can't be tainted. The lotus flower meaning in Buddhism also refers to rebirth and the core belief of reincarnation.

**16.3 THE DUALITY OF PEACE CONCEPT**

[http://egyankosh.ac.in/bitstream/123456789/20278/1/Unit-16.pdf](http://egyankosh.ac.in/bitstream/123456789/20278/1/Unit-16.pdf)

The concept of peace has two connotations- negative peace and positive peace. Negative
peace is defined as not only the absence of organised violence between such major human
groups as nations, but also between racial and ethnic groups because of the magnitude that
can be reached by internal wars. Positive peace is defined as a pattern of cooperation and
integration between major human groups. Absence of violence should not be confused with
absence of conflict. Violence may occur without conflict and conflict may be resolved by
means of non-violent mechanisms. The distinction between these two types of peace gives
to a four fold classification of relations between two nations.

1. a) War which is organised group violence;
2. b) Negative peace, where there is no violence but no other form of interaction either, and
where the best characterisation is peaceful coexistence;
3. c) Positive peace where there is some cooperation with occasional outbreaks of violence
and unqualified peace;
4. d) Unqualified peace, where absence of violence is combined with a pattern of cooperation.

The concept of peace as non-war is neither theoretically nor practically interesting, for example,
in describing the relationship that obtains between Norway and Nepal; it can often be explained
in terms of a low level of inter-action resulting from geographical distance and thus will hardly
be identified by many as ideal relations worth striving for. For peace, like health, has both
cognitive and evaluative components; it designates a state of system of Nations, but this state
is so highly valued that institutions are built around it to protect and promote it. It is the
concept of Positive Peace that is worth exploring, especially since negative peace is a condition,
sin-qua-non; and the two concepts of peace may be empirically related, even though they are
logically independent.

In the absence of solid empirical research and a coherent peace theory, the concept of peace
can be explicated by means of examining peace thinking. Just as there is no lack of attention
paid to war, so there is no scarcity of peace plans and an extensive typology would be needed
to do justice to most of the latter. Peace is a problem of social organisation and the theory
of peace and war will hopefully someday, subsumed under the general theory of social
organisation.

- Has to be applied on a large scale - enforced (schools,work,cafes(meditation minutes)
- becomes daily activity for everyone.

**The Focusing Illusion**

“Nothing In Life Is As Important As You Think It Is, While You Are Thinking About It“

This is a reference to the focusing illusion, which magnifies the importance of something just because of your heightened attention on it.

The incident about which you are thinking and focusing on becomes MORE important to you than it really is (in the grand scheme of things).

(OUR INCREDIBLY LARGE HABBIT OF LATCHING ON 

- I DID THIS → THIS IS MINE
- I HAD THAT → IT IS ME
- I HAD THAT → I CAN ALSO HAVE IT NOW
- I HAD THAT → YOU CANT HAVE IT!

**ALL OF OUR DECISIONS, REACTIONS, THOUGHTS, WISHES, DEMANDS, ADDICTIONS REVOLVE AROUND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST AND WHAT IS HAPPENING INT HE REST OF THE WORLD.**

IN THE MODERN DAY INFORMATIONS IS TOO FREE AND TOO WIDESPREAD, GIVING EVERYONE THE CHOICE TO COMPOSE THEIR PERFECT LIFE IN THEIR IMAGINATION → AND THEN TRYING TO CHASE THAT IN REAL. 

HOWEVER THIS IS A GRAND ILLUSION BECAUSE NOBODY'S LIFE IS EVER HOW IT SEEMS AND YOU CAN NOT MAKE YOURS EXACTLY HOW YOU IMAGE IT.

ON THE BRIGHT SIDE → IF YOUR LEARN TO ENJOY EVERY MOMENT, YOU WONT HAVE TIME OR EVEN THE WISH/ENERGY TO THINK ABOUT A "FAIRYTALE IMAGINARY PEFECT LIFE". 

ME HAS TO CHANGE TO WE (BUT THIS MEANS THAT THERE HAS TO BE A STANDARD, WHICH EVERYONE HELPS EACH OTHER GET TO?)

For example, you receive 10 praises and 1 constructive criticism on a performance evaluation. What do you zero in on? Yep, the one negative.

The focusing illusion then magnifies its importance. It becomes THE most important comment, far outweighing the numerous positive comments we also received.

So, how can you counteract the effects of the focusing illusion… and actually make it a force for good in your life?

RE-DEFINING THE WORD AND CHARACTER "NEGATIVE" → SEEING IT MORE AS FUEL FOR THE NEXT STEP

# **Using the Focusing Illusion to Your Advantage**

Because of our [natural inclination to focus on the negative](https://www.wiseinsights.net/3-proven-ways-boost-daily-joy-research-backed/), which then magnifies its significance, I think it is wise to **intentionally focus on those positive aspects that will ultimately help you move forward faster and further** rather than drag you down into acting like a victim.

This approach is not only recommended by modern psychological research, it is affirmed by time-tested wisdom like Philippians 4:8 (“**Whatever is praiseworthy and commendable, let your mind dwell on these things.**”).

For example, this classic quote demonstrates how focusing on the positive dimension of a situation can reorient your perspective and help you avoid getting mired in a negative cycle:

> “Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened.”

As you focus on the positive dimension of a situation, it grows larger and more important… increasing your sense of hope and joy

**“True peace is not merely the absence of tension: it is the presence of justice.”** Martin Luther King.

You cannot just eliminate the negative energies and hope for everything to go well, it will naturally form back into negativity since that is the natural human way to think ( thats why it is so present now) 

It would take much more hard work to teach the importances of life to everyone (the majority is captivated by distractions which they do not understand - that is why they like them)

Meditation and mindfulness has to be taught as something new and revolutionary (can't be seen as an ancient thing, because then people wont accept it as a modern factor. 

THE TRUTH OF MINDFULNESS APPS? SCAM, NEW NATURAL WAY!

Consider Norwegian far-right terrorist Anders Behring Breivik, who used meditation to dull his emotions before he went on a shooting spree; or Twitter’s CEO, Jack Dorsey, whose latest vanity project was a ten-day silent meditation retreat and digital detox on a remote island off the coast of Myanmar. Of course, he tweeted out his accomplishment to the world, complete with photos of his 117 mosquito bites. For the Silicon Valley elite, such retreats have become status symbols of techno-martyrdom, minus any real action to curb the addictive and distracting effects of the social media they control.

Over the past few months Transformation has published a number of articles that help to answer that question, kicked off by my critique of “The faux revolution of mindfulness.” A number of common themes have emerged from this series. The first is the need to see, teach and experience mindfulness within a broader social context if its potential as a force for change is to be realized. In “Moving mindfulness from ‘me’ to ‘we’” I call this a shift towards ‘civic’ mindfulness that enables individuals to see more clearly how their everyday experiences and personal troubles are entangled with public issues.

Existential suffering of the human condition - the suffering of sickness, old age and death, anxiety and stress, conflicts in personal relationships, divorce and personal loss - has long been the domain of religious consolation and pastoral care, individual counseling and psychotherapy, and, more recently, of mindfulness-based interventions. This is the first-order of suffering.

Second-order suffering concerns human evil and atrocities where the source of suffering is readily identifiable - whether it be victims of violent crimes or murders, children caged in detention centers, whole populations suffering from wars, genocide or social and environmental injustice, or oppressive working conditions.

The problem is that human distress is no longer limited to or demarcated by these two orders of suffering. Greed, ill will, and delusion - what Buddhists consider the three root causes of suffering - have become [institutionalized](http://www.religiousconsultation.org/Great_Awakening_by_Loy.htm). This institutionalization makes a third order of suffering difficult to identify because it has become so amorphous, pervasive and systemic. As Bruce Rogers-Vaughan puts it, “Oppressors no longer have faces, even the impersonal ‘faces’ of the state, the corporation, or the church. Third-order suffering does not simply replace first or second-order suffering. Rather, it arises alongside them. The three orders coexist and interpenetrate. They too are entangled.”

**CHANGING?**

Hence, suffering that is purely private in its causes and effects no longer exists. To become truly revolutionary, teachers of mindfulness need new practices that reflect this fact and are capable of tackling the entangled nature of distress. This requires a much wider focus, using communal practices to develop insights into how our social and political experience is embodied.

A civic-oriented mindfulness helps individuals to cut through the obscuring fog of third-order suffering in order to recognize that the anxieties, insecurities and rage they feel are political, not merely personal in nature. But we cannot take on such a task in isolation. Civic mindfulness is grounded in community formation by recognizing our shared vulnerabilities and mutual interdependence. In this way, people can come to see how social conditioning has influenced their identities and how they have internalized messages of competition, violence and domination. This form of mindfulness offers an opportunity to reorient practices away from instrumental ends towards a more prophetic critique of underlying problems and solutions.
