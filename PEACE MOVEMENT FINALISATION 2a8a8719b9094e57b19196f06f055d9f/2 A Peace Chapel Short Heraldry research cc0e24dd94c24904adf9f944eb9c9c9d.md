# 2. A Peace Chapel & Short Heraldry research

Just like religions are a form of meditation for humans, a peace chapel insists individuals to take a pause in this hectic, non-stop cycle of life. Since we as individuals can not escape the tangled capitalist rules, we must find peace within. Within the unescapable materialism, addiction, distraction and self doubt of the carefully structured system, lays your personality. By presenting the chaos of today in a static, highly visual, symbolical and figurative manner, the peace chapel gives the individual a sign of a bigger picture(where consumerism/society is disconnected forms soul), or at least initiates a reflection train of thought. By gathering around the chapel, individuals are placed into a community scenario, forgetting their devices, anxieties and distractions. Anti-consumerism driven social medium, initiating conversations across every type of individual, forgetting about their digital following.

Limiting myself to find peace  content only from posters and pins from the archive, I strive to refresh and re-embellish them in to something understandable today. However to represent todays situation better, where here is not so much physical war but mass surveillance, deception and materialism, I find symbols that represent assets or ideas from these problems.

Even before these times I had a huge fascination about the idea of  "government approved" and billboards int he street. Now it has gone even further. In these pandemic times, they decided to create boards displaying information that everyone has heard, seen and talked about countless times. The aesthetic of this board - thick, plastic, solid and seemingly indestructible, being held by a cement block. It seems this sign would still be standing after a huge storm. What if this approved manner of message spreading was used to achieve mass wellness and mindfulness.

SHORT HERALDRY RESEARCH (IDENTITY)

Coat of arms, the principal part of a system of hereditary symbols dating back to early medieval Europe, used primarily to establish identity in battle. Arms evolved to denote family descent, adoption, alliance, property ownership, and, eventually, profession.

The origin of the term coat of arms is in the surcoat, the cloth tunic worn over armour to shield it from the sun’s rays. It repeated the bearer’s arms as they appeared on his banner or pennon and on his shield, and it was particularly useful to the heralds as they toured the battlefield identifying the dead. It also identified the knight in the social surroundings of the tournament. What today is popularly termed a “coat of arms” is properly an armorial or heraldic “achievement” and consists of a shield accompanied by a warrior’s helmet, the mantling which protects his neck from the sun (usually slashed fancifully to suggest having been worn in battle), the wreath which secures the mantling and crest to the helmet, and the crest itself (the term for the device above the helmet, not a synonym for the arms). Additions to the achievement may include badges, mottoes, supporters, and a crown or coronet.

The surface of the shield (or escutcheon) is the field. This is divided into chief and base (top and bottom), sinister and dexter (left and right, from the viewpoint of the bearer of the shield, so that sinister is on the right of one facing the shield). Combinations of these terms, together with pale (the centre vertical third) and fess (the centre horizonal third), create a grid of nine points to locate the charges, or designs, placed upon the shield. The centre of the pale in chief is the honour point, the center of the pale in base is the nombril point, and the exact centre of the shield is the fess point.

Today social media is our heraldry, but can w exchange that, can we present a static, refined, high quality symbol that encapsulates us and does not reveal too much. Revealing is a problem because it  encourages an overflow of information which might be highly personal and unnecessary..etc

What happens when you remove the symbols from a coat of arms and are left with colors. You naturalise something that is completely unique, something that communicates identity. **Light symbolism with exaggerated color.** It communicate achievement, what are the moral achievements of humans today?

The colouring of the shield and the charges it bears developed slowly. When heraldry was confined to display on flags, the tinctures (colours) were the metals or (gold, yellow) and argent (silver, white) and the colours gules (red) and azure (blue). Sable (black) was difficult in the early days because it was derived from an indigo dye that often faded enough to be confused with azure. Vert (green) was then uncommon because it required an expensive dye imported from Sinople (now Sinop, Turkey) on the Black Sea (in French heraldry vert is still termed sinople). Purpure (purple) was even less common, since it was derived from rare shellfish (murex). Later, when shields were routinely decorated with the designs borne on the flags, furs were added to the tinctures, initially those of ermine (from the winter stoat) and vair (from the squirrel). These furs had distinctive patterns that later would be coloured variously to produce such artificial furs as ermines, erminois, and pean. The squirrel’s fur, dark on the back and light on the belly, was cut up and assembled into many designs. The terminology is not consistent; while the term tinctures is usually applied to heraldic metals, colours, and furs, some writers restrict it to mean colours only; some use the term colours to mean metals, tinctures (colours), and furs, and others use colours to mean metals and tinctures but treat furs separately.
